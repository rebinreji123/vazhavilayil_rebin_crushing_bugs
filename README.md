## Introduction

The Project Name is code debugging. The idea if this project is to learn how to debugg codes. The code provided was a puzzle solver game. The code contained two bugs that the students is supposed to solve.

## Features

[List the main features or functionalities of the project. Provide a brief description of each feature.]

1. **Feature 1**: This puzzle game has different puzzle images to choose from.
2. **Feature 2**: can reset the game however many times one want. 

## Requirements

In order to make the puzzle game run smoothly, i had to solve two bugs present in the code. 
1. You can drag and drop more than one puzzle piece into a drop zone -
   this shouldnâ€™t happen. There should only be one piece in one drop zone at a time
2. pieces appearing in the drop zones on reset / choosing a new puzzle. Those should be removed /
   reparented back to the drag zone as well, so that the player has a fresh board to drop onto.


## Plan

The first bug I solved was the reset button not working and along with it the bug of reseting the puzzle image while choosing a new puzzle.

The second bug i solved was the image overlaying on one another.
